# Change Log
All notable changes to OpenRasta will be documented in this file.
OpenRasta adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [Unreleased]
### Added
 - Better late than never, we've moved the code that our friends at Just-Eat
   contributed ages ago, and it now ships in an updated version as part of our
   main package. Any host compatible with OWIN (as in the specification) can
   now use OpenRasta. Ain't life awesome?
 - if you use Microsoft's Katana, aka `Microsoft.Owin`, we built a convenience 
   package, `OpenRasta.Hosting.Katana`. It should also work with any host
   implementing `IAppBuilder`. There's also a convenience package for asp.net
   core, `OpenRasta.Hosting.AspNetCore`. It doesn't do much but saves you a bit
   of typing compared to wiring up the OWIN signatures.   
 - We've added a `OpenRasta.Codecs.Newtonsoft.Json` package, because frankly,
   `DataContract`s are long dead.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed


## [2.6.0-preview.1]
### Added
 - A new pipeline with "double tap" semantics, which makes most of the old pipeline
   look like an old picture, keen memories but visibly dated.
 - Things don't always happen when we want them too, so everything has been made
   async. This includes async contributors with a new `NotifyAsync`, async
   handlers (just return `Task` or `Task<T>`), codecs with `IMediaTypeReaderAsync`
   and `IMediaTypeWriterAsync`, and async interceptor with `IOperationInterceptorAsync`.
 - We have an all new in-the-box IoC container. While removing the container from
   OpenRasta is on the cards, it's a long path, and in the meantime we now provide
   you with a production-grade one, lock-free, fast, and just plain better. You
   can even inject `Func<>` and `IEnumerable<>` now. Thanks to our friends at Olo
   for sponsoring that work!

### Changed
 - Cool kids have moved on, so we follow. .net 4.6.1 is now a minimum, and we ship
   netstandard2.0 too. Are we cool now? 🕶
 - The AppVeyor build is now under the OpenRasta organisation. We were not
   really organised before, so we (well, @holytshirt) sorted it out, and we feel
   much cleaner.
 - `IPipeline` can now only be used in the contributor configuration pahse
   `IEnumerable`.
 - Methods on handlers returning `void` or `Task` will now return a 202 accepted
   instead of a 204 no content. If we can't know the semantics we shouldn't give
   any better guarantees. If you wish to return a 200, return an OperationResult
   instead.
 - Operations that were not ready for invocation would sometime fail. Now,
   either we respond with a 400 when we can't match the request to the response,
   or a `500` if we can't chose the correct method because the call was ambiguous.
 - I think errors should be given as much attention as non-errors, that's why we
   always content negotiate those errors, so we can exceptionally render exceptional
   exceptions using whatever codec you want to use, which is great for your APIs,
   but a bit less for your tests. You can now chose if you want that functionality
   or if you'd rather let exceptions bubble up, so your server can show their default
   error page or whatever.
 - ⌚️ is relative, apparently. But `RedirectLocation` wasn't. So we allowed relative
   URIs.
 - RFC 2047 may sound like black magic, but if you need it, there's a new implementation
   that should be a tad more accurate, and not throw random exceptions on .net core
 - The `HttpListerHost` has been refactored to manage connections better, clean-up better
   and be more usable. Thanks @nmosafi!
 - With the new container having non-deterministic ordering of components, finding
   in which order to wire-up a pipeline is a bit more... Well less... Well it's non
   deterministic. So we switched the default call graph generator to the topological
   one we've had for a while. Check your pipelines. If you wish to revert to the old
   behaviour, a simple `ResourceSpace.Use.CustomDependency<IGenerateCallGraphs,WeightedCallGraphGenerator>()`
   should do the trick, although we don't recommend that.


### Deprecated
 - All members bar `Notify` on `IPipeline`. Because really, why would you ever
   want to know anything about the pipeline.
 - `IOperationHydrator` is no more. If you have your own, we'll respect that,
   but we'd rather you used our new and shiny `IRequestEntityReader`.
 - PipelineContinuation is moslty gone, it wasn't really meant to be used externally.
   We made `Abort` obsolete, you should instead throw an exception from the
   contributor, for those moments exceptional stuff happens. Even `Finished` was
   a bit of a lie. You reached the end of the line or you didn't, and that's all
   that ever really mattered. The responsible developer is very sorry and promised
   he will never lie again.

### Removed
 - We try not to remove stuff before the 3.0 jump, so if anything disappeared
   by accident, for exemple in `PipelineData`, please let us know, it's a bug.

### Fixed
 - When padding error messages in HTML for IE clients, we would send an
   incorrect Length, and no one wants that, so we made it accurate and bigger.
 - We would try and pad the result even if the response stream is not seekable,
   now we check correctly.

### Security

## [2.5.2001] - 2017-12-21
### Fixed
 - A lock-free container can result in unpredictable ordering of the components
   you get, and OpenRasta's filters were not as independent as we thought. The
   issue is fixed differently in 2.6, but here's a patch for the 2.5 release that
   fixes the issue with handler methods without attributes not being found when
   there's a uri name in the route.

## [2.5.2000] - 2017-12-12
### Changed
 - Releases can take longer than expected, look at Duke Nukem Forever. The 2.6 release
   is so full of goodness that we're spending a bit more time polishing it. In the
   meantime, thanks to the sponsorship of our friends at olo.com, we backported
   some of that goodness to the 2.5 branch.

## [2.5.1050] - 2016-12-15
### Fixed
 - When we removed the authentication support from the out of the box experience,
   we forgot that some people took dependencies on this essential step of the
   pipeline. We apologised profusely and reintroduced
    `KnownStages.IAuthentication` promptly.

## [2.5.1023] - 2016-08-24
### Changed
 - Made uri to handler method parameters mapping case-insensitive.

## [2.5.63] - 2016-03-22
### Fixed
 - Removes a resource leak in the multipart codec

### Changed
 - The error message when an operation was not ready to be executed was a bit
   terse and not very helpful. We made it more helpful.

## [2.5.59] - 2015-10-23

### Changed
 - Improved Content-Disposition header parsing
 - IHttpEntity is now disposable, and disposed properly

## [2.5.54] - 2015-08-11
### Fixed
 - Concurrency issue in SurrogateBuilderProvider

## [2.5.53] - 2015-03-18
### Added
 - The pipeline can use a new topological sort instead of a weighted sort
   with potentially better support for more complex pipelines. Can be added
   through the container with an `ICallGraphGenerator`

### Fixed
 - Query strings now get + processing correctly

## [2.5.48] - 2015-02-23
### Added
 - forms now support nullable Guids

## [2.5.46] - 2015-06-02
### Fixed
 - Object binders on parameters had been inadventantly removed when
   migrating to GitHub. They now work as expected.
 - Malformed Guids would cause 500. They now don't match.


## [2.5.42] - 2015-01-20
### Fixed
 - A malformed Accept header would cause a 500, it now ignores malformed
   values, and returns a 400 if all values are invalid.

### Added
 - OperationResult.Accepted has been added


## [2.5.34] - 2014-12-16
### Changed
 - The Codec response selection would always set the pipeline as finished,
   preventing contributors from running afterwards. The contributor was changed
   to only set the pipeline as continue.

## [2.5.31] - 2014-10-08
### Fixed
 - error HTML and CSS files were incorrectly shipped in NuGet packages

## [2.5.28] - 2014-10-08
### Fixed
 - Race condition in HttpListenerHost on Dispose

## [2.5.23] - 2014-09-03

This release has no new features or fixes.

## [2.5.21] - 2014-09-03
### Added
 - OpenRasta.Testing now contains reusable context base classes

## [2.5.13] - 2014-08-21
### Added
 - `HttpMethod` now has a `Patch`

## [2.5.7] - 2014-06-26

Previous OpenRasta versions are not included as they were on OpenWrap.

### Changed
 - OpenRasta is now on nuget
