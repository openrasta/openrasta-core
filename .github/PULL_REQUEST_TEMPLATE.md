Hi there!

Thank you so much for contributing this pull request. We love when the community
steps up and share, and we're enormously thankful.

You don't have to do all of those following things, they are what we try and get 
done for code coming in:

 - [x] the code
 - [ ] If it's a non-trivial piece of code, signing a CLA
 - [ ] If it breaks, change, fix or add to existing behaviour, updating
       CHANGELOG.md
 - [ ] If it's a bug fix, tests in the Tests `project`, or scenarios in the `TestRig`.
 - [ ] On top of HEAD, unless it's a bugfix on a previous version
 - [ ] VERSION file updated if not creating a pull-request on top of `master`

If those are needed, and you haven't and can't, we thank you enromously for your
contirbution, and we'll add those before merging the pull request.

Thanks!

The OpenRasta community
